/*
    Example 1:
    Intervals: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
    Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
    Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged them into one [1,5].
    
    Example 2:
    Intervals: [[6,7], [2,4], [5,9]]
    Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
    Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into one [5,9].

    Example 3:
    Intervals: [[1,4], [2,6], [3,5]]
    Output: [[1,6]]
    Explanation: Since all the given intervals overlap, we merged them into one.
