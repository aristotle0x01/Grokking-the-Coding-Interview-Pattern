/*
Problem Statement 
    Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’, find the length of the smallest 
    contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists.
    
    Example 1:
    Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7 
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum great than or equal to '7' is [5, 2].
    
    Example 2:
    Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 8], S=7 
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to '7' is [8].
    
    Example 3:
    Input: [3, 4, 1, 1, 6], S=8 
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Smallest subarrays with a sum greater than or equal to '8' are [3, 4, 1] or [1, 1, 6].
